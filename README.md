## 🚀 Inspiration

This project was inspired by a Canadian friend who decided to live on Mars time, yes you read that right! Since a Martian day (or "sol") is about 24 hours and 40 minutes long, they adjusted their daily schedule to sync with the Red Planet. This app lets you do the same, or explore the time on any planet in our solar system.

## ⏳ Time Calculation

### Earth Time
  
  Earth time is displayed according to your local time zone.

### Mars Time

    Mars time is calculated using the Julian Date (JD) formula. The current Mars time is derived by converting the Julian Date to Mars Sol Date (MSD) and then to Mars Coordinated Time (MTC). This method ensures accuracy in representing a sol (Martian day).

### Other Planets

    For all other planets, the time is calculated using a simple ratio based on the length of their day relative to Earth's day. This provides an approximate but fun representation of what time it might be on those planets.

## 🛠 Customization

- Add New Planets: Edit the allPlanetsOfSolarSystem array in App.svelte to include more celestial bodies.
- Change Styles: Modify the CSS in the style section of App.svelte to tweak the app’s appearance.
